                Hi Jigsel! Its been a while since I wrote to you. Dati lagi
                kitang ginagawan ng ganito mapa ano man yung okasyon, pasko,
                birthday, new year, diba? Surely ako namiss ko yung feeling :D
                Even though I have wrote to you several times there is still
                that feeling everytime I write. Ewan ko, it feels as if
                everytime I plan to write or even if I started to write na my
                mind goes overthinking kase I want to give you the best message
                you could recieve how could I deliver that perfect message? Yun
                yung tumatakbo sa isip ko whenever I write these messages to
                you, I don't know exactly why pero I think and this might sound
                a bit cheesy pero it might be because you're that special to me?
                Oh easy kalang wag masyado lalaki ulo hehe. The past months was
                a mix of positives and negatives for the both of us, don't you
                agree? From the start of this year until now was a roller
                coaster of emotions, there were times that were hard to get by,
                moments that I wish would last forever, and right now as you are
                reading this is something I want to cherish. It's your birthday,
                I hope you enjoy it which you did of course, treasure yan eh!
                *insert common things people say during birthdays*. Ok I'm done
                with the common wishes for birthdays HAHA! Kidding aside, may
                mga specifics na gusto kong i-wish for you during your special
                day, I wish that this day and the days to come would continue
                shape you to someone who you want to be in the future, you are
                almost a fully grown adult and with that comes a lot of decision
                making, I wish that you make the wisest possible decisions for
                the benefit of yourself and those around you, I also wish you
                goodluck in your incoming college studies and I hope to see you
                survive it haslkjdhalskjdjhalkjsdh fighting! I wish that you
                would enjoy life before it becomes boring (Jigsel work era), and
                lastly I wish that we hang out more!! HAHA! the last one's a bit
                personal pero I couldn't help it :p apart from the wishes, I
                wanted to tell you also about the brief backstory on why I chose
                to make you a website instead of just traditionally giving you
                presents or flowers something of that sort. So a few months back
                since we met again, which I was glad happened, you didn't forget
                about my birthday, so it would be just fair to return the favor
                but of course in typical Baskin fashion I wanted it to be unique
                and extra for someone that is very dear to me, so I thought of
                something which would be a unique present or gift that I can
                produce and website was the top candidate of them all. I won't
                go on bragging how fking hard this was, but since I had
                backgrounds in programming I tried to re-learn how to make a
                website and learn a few more advanced methods hence the
                imitation of the instagram website. Why instagram? cause I
                originally thought of a compilation of pics and vids I had of us
                in my phone gallery, and I thought that this was best way to
                showcase photos and videos. It may not be the best website
                you'll ever see and certainly not the most professional, but I
                assure you every single letter typed in this code was from the
                top til bottom of my heart! &lt;3 <br />
                <br />
                To close things of here, I want to let you know that you are a
                very special and dear person to me. Also I still meant
                everything that I said to tita Hazel before, I just want to
                enjoy what we have right now and care for you and keep you
                happy, as friend, as lover, even as a brother, as a father, as a
                grandfather, as a great great grandfather, ay napasobra na ata
                sori, as an enemy, as parishmate, and anything you could think
                of! If you're thinking why do you deserve this, I wouldn't be
                able to explain it in words but you just do. Let's just say you
                made a positive impact in my life. Alright this was a bit long
                so I hope u didn't get bored with it HAHA! more hangouts soon
                and stay healthy, safe, and smiling Jigsel! I love you &LT;3!!
